"""Check the built dashboard against the SHELEG Workbench pack's rules that are never waived.

Written as a tool because a check done by hand produces false positives, and
they teach one lesson: **a checker must know the difference between the thing
and what the thing is talking about.**

* A `prefers-color-scheme` inside a COMMENT of the copied token layer is not a
  second theme source. Comments are stripped before the CSS is examined.
* An emoji inside the DATA block can be a repository description quoted
  faithfully from upstream. The pack bans emoji in product-UI chrome; editing a
  measurement to satisfy a style rule would be the worse defect. Only the
  chrome is examined.

Exits non-zero on a real violation.
