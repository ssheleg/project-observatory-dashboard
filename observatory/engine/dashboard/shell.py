"""The dashboard's shell: which pages exist, how they are linked, what each carries.

One page of 1.3 MB with seven tabs was the whole surface until 2026-09-14, and
the operator's verdict was that it could not be used: alerts above navigation,
one `main` for seven subjects, nothing addressable, everything loaded for
anything (plan v2, M1; scenario S12). The split keeps ONE template and ONE
script — every page is the same HTML with a `PAGE` constant, a navigation bar
in place of the tab strip, and only the DATA that page renders — so nothing is
rendered twice by two code paths, and a fix to a renderer reaches every page.

`docs/projects-dashboard.html` stays as the full single page (the tests, the
smoke harness and the design checks read it), and `docs/dashboard/*.html` are
the pages a person opens. Both come from `build_dashboard.py` in one run.
