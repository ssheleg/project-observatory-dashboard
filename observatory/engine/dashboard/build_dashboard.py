    The arithmetic happens HERE because both filters are known here: `counts`
    in `registry/findings.json` already excludes acknowledged findings, and so
    does the list below, so the two agree exactly. Recomputing a total in the
    page's script would duplicate what the payload already holds.

    **Every open row is carried.** Rows are kept in the builder's own order —
    severity, then deadline, then id — and each type's rows beyond
    `FINDINGS_ON_PAGE` are marked `folded`, so the page shows them under a
    per-type control that names their count instead of dropping them.

    The findings surface is the ONLY one a row of severity `info` reaches: the
