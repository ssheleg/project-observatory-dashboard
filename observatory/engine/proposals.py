"""What a registry proposal may change, and where an accepted one lands.

**A proposal cannot be applied to the registry.** `registry/*.json` is rewritten
whole from the model on every emit, so a patch written there survives until the
next tick and no longer. That is not a limitation to work around: it is why the
project has a CURATION layer — `collectors/project_overrides.json`,
`repo_overrides.json`, `repo_status.json` — which the emitter reads and applies
on top of what it measured. An accepted proposal belongs there, and nowhere else.

**So the appliable set is not a matter of taste.** It is exactly the fields those
files supply, derived from them rather than restated here: a second list would
drift, and a proposal for a field nothing can apply is a row that can only ever
be listed. Measured 2026-09-07, before this existed:

    observatory_propose(target_id="project:also-not-real", …)   -> "proposed"
    patch={"activity_tier": …, "id": …, "source_refs": …}       -> "proposed"
    patch with no evidence at all                                -> "proposed"

The first names a subject that does not exist. The second asks to change a
DERIVED field the emitter recomputes, the record's own id, and its provenance.
The third contradicts the tool's own field description — "A patch with no
evidence is a guess" — which was documentation rather than a rule.

**`domain:` accepts nothing, and that is a decision rather than a gap.**
`registry/domains.json` is the operator's transcription of two documents they
supplied; the emitter does not derive it and there is no overrides file for it.
A domain proposal would have no landing place, so it is refused with that reason
instead of queued for ever.
