"""The one boundary where a model, its window and its price are resolved.

Nothing else in this repository may name a vendor id or a price. Both come from
`agent/models.json` (the chain) and OpenRouter's own catalogue (the numbers),
because a price table in source is wrong the day a provider changes one and
nothing notices.

Three things this owns, each earned rather than invented:

* **Selection has three levels** — the caller, the config, the default — resolved
  here and *logged*, because "why did it use that model" is otherwise
  unanswerable.
* **Attempts are capped in TOTAL**, not per model. Three models times three
  retries is nine calls for one prompt.
* **Spend is enforced on the write.** `charge()` records and enforces in the same
  breath; enforcement on a schedule arrives after the money is gone.

The wallet is denominated in **credits**, which is what OpenRouter's usage
accounting reports. One credit tracks one dollar at the time of writing; this
module will not relabel the provider's unit on its behalf.

Failover happens BETWEEN calls, never inside one. That is free here — each call
is a single turn with no accumulated trajectory — and it is the boundary that
matters, because reasoning carries a vendor credential that does not travel and
fails as a 400 rather than as degradation.

#: simply falls through to the secret store. A degradation that cannot be tested
#: is a degradation nobody has seen work.
#: THE PROJECT'S OWN KEY WINS. The secret store's key is the MACHINE's shared
#: secret — every agent on the host may reach OpenRouter through it — so if it
#: came first, a key placed in this repository for this project alone could
#: never be the one that got used, and the remedy an operator would reach for
#: when the shared key hits its limit (give the observatory its own key) would
#: be inert by construction. A specific credential beats a shared fallback; the
