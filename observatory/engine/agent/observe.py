"""The LLM layer. It reads deltas, writes proposals, and cannot promote them.

Delta-driven, not poll-driven: with an empty delta table it exits having spent
nothing, which is what makes a scheduled agent affordable on a quiet machine.

**Nothing here names a model or a price.** Both live behind `agent/providers.py`,
which resolves the chain from `agent/models.json` and the numbers from the
provider's own catalogue. A price table in source is wrong the day a provider
changes one, and nothing notices.

**The ceiling is enforced on the write, in credits.** Three independent
guardrails converge on one answer: a daily cap, a monthly cap, and spend
velocity over a rolling window, because the first two catch a runaway tomorrow.

Degradation is honest in four places, because each is a real state:
  * no credential      -> collectors-only, deltas left unconsumed, said out loud
  * guardrail reached  -> same, plus which guardrail and the spend behind it
  * every model failed -> same; the chain is marked unhealthy and re-probed later
  * one call fails     -> that project's delta stays unconsumed, the others proceed

Nothing here approves anything. Every row lands `proposed` with confidence < 1;
promotion is the operator's or a second corroboration's.

- Say `worth_recording: false` whenever nothing non-obvious happened. A mechanical

- Never invent a cause. You see a diff summary, not the work. If the delta

  read as true by everything downstream and nothing can distinguish it later.
