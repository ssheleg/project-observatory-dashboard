// The one screen a person reads had every assertion pointed at its DATA —
// `from_store()` returns the right numbers — and none at whether the page turns
// those numbers into anything. The health panel was filled four times in one
// night without the page ever being opened, and a JavaScript error would have
// left it blank with every Python test still green.
//
// A browser was not reachable (the Chrome extension is not connected on this
// machine), so this is the honest substitute: node, a minimal DOM that records
// what the script writes, and the script's real output on stdout as JSON. It
// catches a syntax error, an undefined reference and an empty panel — which is
// what "checked in a browser" was protecting against — and it does not pretend
// to check layout, fonts or colour.
