"""What the event collector records, and what it must SAY when it does not.

Two defects, one shape: a bound that binds in silence.

A fixed `git log -N` depth silently drops every commit past N: `git log -200`
returning 200 rows looks exactly like a repository that has 200 commits, so a
store can hold a fraction of the commits inside its retention window with
nothing anywhere saying so. Truncation must be detectable and reported.

And a collector that records every repository, while the companion plugin's
recorder refuses anything but the estate's own work, lets `external` projects
dominate the counts. A "which project is most active" answer built on that
names somebody else's tool.
