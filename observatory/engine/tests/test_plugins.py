"""The plugin seam, and what it refuses.

Adding an analytics source used to mean editing six core files — the step table,
the merge, the emitter, the validator, the findings builder and the dashboard.
The reason was a category error rather than a missing abstraction: a traffic
figure was being treated as a REGISTRY FACT. It is not one. The registry answers
what EXISTS, is validated, lives in git and is rewritten whole on every emit; a
measurement taken at an instant accumulates and belongs beside `events`.

So the seam is one contract, and the interesting half is not that a plugin can
write — it is what happens when one misbehaves. A plugin that can write any
metric name is a plugin whose output nobody can check, and every rule below is
driven with a plugin planted to break it.
