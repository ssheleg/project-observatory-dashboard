"""What the wire DECLARES must be what the wire DOES.

Three gaps, all of one shape — a statement nothing honoured:

* **`asOfScanId` was declared and unreachable.** The capability's input schema
  types it, `survey.py` implements it, and the MCP tool did not expose it. The
  contract's step 3 requires a host to compile that schema before any project
  data is supplied, so a host would have constructed a call this server could not
  honour — and `fabric/FABRIC-CONFORMANCE.md` rests its `idempotency: supported`
  claim on precisely that parameter.

* **`observatory_search` spent money outside every guardrail.** It embeds the
  query, and `providers.embed()` CHARGES the wallet, but nothing checked before
  spending, on a tool any MCP client can call. The agent had long guarded itself
  while the wire handed out unmetered credits beside it.

* **The served `instructions` said "Read-only" and named three tools** while
  eight were served and two of them write. That string is what an LLM client
  reads to decide what the server can do; a stale one is not cosmetic.
