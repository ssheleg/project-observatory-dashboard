"""The split dashboard: nine pages, two shared files, and what each page carries.

WHY THIS FILE. The single page was 1.3 MB with seven tabs, and the operator's
verdict was that it could not be used (plan v2, M1; scenario S12). The split
answers it, and three of its properties break silently:

  1. the NAVIGATION must come before the findings in the document — three
     earlier iterations put alerts above the way out, and every one of them
     passed every check that existed;
  2. a page must carry ONLY the data it renders, or the split saves nothing;
  3. the shared style and script must sit BESIDE the page as relative
     siblings, or `file://` — which is how these pages are opened most of the
     time — loads a page with no style and no script at all.

`dashboard/smoke_pages.py` executes each page; this reads what smoke cannot:
document order, byte size, the slice, and the routes the server answers with.
