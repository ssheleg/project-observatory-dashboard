"""The one screen a person reads, EXECUTED rather than inspected.

Every earlier assertion about the dashboard pointed at its data:
`from_store()` returns the right numbers, and `tests/test_dashboard_store.py`
checks that it does. None of them asked whether the page turns those numbers
into anything. The health panel was filled four times in one night — registry
proposals, the projection's lag, the spend — and the page was never opened, so a
JavaScript error would have left it blank with the whole suite green.

**Executing it found a row that had never rendered once.** The spend line tested
`H.wallet.month`, and `store/wallet.json` holds `months: {"2026-09": 0.0924}`
with no scalar of that name — so the condition was false on every render. A
branch whose true side is unreachable, in the screen the estate exists to show,
invisible to every test that looked at the data behind it.

A browser was not reachable here (the Chrome extension is not connected), so the
check is node with a minimal DOM that records what the script writes:
`tests/render_dashboard.mjs`. It catches a syntax error, an undefined reference
and an empty panel, which is what "checked in a browser" was protecting against.
It does not check layout, fonts or colour, and does not pretend to.

**Three of the first four failures were the harness, not the page** — a bare
`addEventListener`, `ResizeObserver`, a `querySelector` returning null — and
each was fixed in the stub rather than recorded as a defect. A harness that
fails differently from a browser tests the harness.
