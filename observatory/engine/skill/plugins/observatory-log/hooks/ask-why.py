"""Turn a record_turn.py result into the Stop hook's structured output.

Standard library only, and silent on anything unexpected: a hook that reports
its own confusion as a failure teaches the operator to disable hooks.

It never blocks. The facts are already on the record without the agent's
cooperation, so the only thing left to ask for is the `why` — and asking is
worth more than a veto that costs a turn. An absent `why` stays visible in the
ledger as a proposed record with a null field, which is accountability without
obstruction.
