"""What counts as this estate's OWN work, in one place.

Two components answer that question and until 2026-09-06 only one of them asked
it. `tools/record_turn.py` — the companion plugin's recorder — refused to write a
session record for anything but an `owned` or `work-bitbucket` project, on the
grounds that "a third-party clone is somebody else's history, and a `why` written
about it is noise the dashboard carries forever". `collectors/scan_events.py`
applied no such rule and recorded every commit in every checkout.

Measured before the rule was shared, a large share of the commits inside the
retention window came from a handful of `external` projects — third-party
clones kept for reference. A statistic built on that answers "where was work
done" with the name of somebody else's project.

One rule, two readers. The same shape as the retention horizon, which
`store/retention.json` holds for both the collector and the pruner after they
spent a live tick deleting and re-inserting each other's rows (trap T25).

#: notes about its own commit rhythm sitting at the top of the operator's queue,
#: because `tools/review.py digest` sorted projects by how many each had
#: produced. The seventeen that rest on something else — a project appearing or
#: vanishing, an owner changing, a repository or a stack arriving — are the ones
#: a person is actually needed for.
#:
#: `last_activity_on-changed` belongs HERE rather than among the structural
#: kinds, and that was checked by reading rather than assumed: the nine records
#: carrying all three read "a single commit was made while the working tree
#: became dirty". It accompanies ordinary work. It appears beside the anomalies
#: too ("the commit count increased tenfold in three days"), which is why the
#: anomalies are not separated out here — no mechanical signal distinguishes

#: one record per SESSION, not per day, so two sessions in one day are
#: two legitimate records and folding them would destroy exactly what the
#: four-part key was written to protect. `estate-history`'s policy was not read
#: at all, which is its own reason not to touch it.
