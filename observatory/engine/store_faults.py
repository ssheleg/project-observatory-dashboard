"""What the machine looked like when the store failed.

Four store failures in three days left nothing to diagnose with:

    disk I/O error                          an agent's write
    file is not a database                  a multi-step job
    database disk image is malformed        an agent's write
    disk I/O error                          an agent's write

`tools/check_store.py` answers `integrity_check` = `ok` every time afterwards, so
the only surviving trace is a message in `store/logs/tick.log`. Free space, WAL
size, how many processes held the file — none of it is recorded, and all of it is
gone by the time anybody looks. Every diagnosis is therefore a guess, and one of
those guesses was handed to this repository's operator as a cause on the strength
of a single correlation.

**Three properties, and the module is small because they are the whole design.**

1. **It does not depend on the store.** Nothing here opens the database or
   imports `store_db`: an instrument that needs the failing component cannot run
   at the moment it is needed. `paths` is the only local import, for the file
   locations.

2. **It cannot raise.** `record()` returns the row it wrote, or `None` when it
   could not write — never an exception. A recorder that raises inside an
   `except` block replaces a diagnosable failure with an undiagnosable one, and
   the traceback the operator then reads is the recorder's, not the fault's.

3. **It does not change behaviour.** Callers record and then RE-RAISE. Three tick
   steps (`retention`, `corroborate`, `notify_findings`) still carry no sqlite
   guard, and that is deliberate: `file is not a database` means the file really
   is broken, so a step that swallows it and carries on keeps a corrupt store in
   service. A stopped step is already reported by `tick.step_failed`.

**The sqlite CODE, not only the message.** `sqlite_errorname` is set by the
sqlite3 module on the exception it raises (never on one constructed by hand), and
it is what separates `SQLITE_IOERR` from `SQLITE_CORRUPT` from `SQLITE_NOTADB` —
where the incidents above are five different English strings for what may be
three different causes.

**Pure append, no read-modify-write.** One line, one `open(..., "a")`, one
`write`. Trimming would mean reading the file back during a failure, which is
both a second chance to fail and a way to lose a concurrent writer's line. The
READER caps instead, and says so. At roughly 400 bytes a fault and four faults in
three days, the file is not a growth problem; when it becomes one, the cap
belongs in `tools/retention.py` beside every other purge.
