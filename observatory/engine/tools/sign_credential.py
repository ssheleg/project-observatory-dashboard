"""Sign a credential: what it is for, who answers for it, how it is known.

    sign_credential.py set <credential-id> --purpose "..." --evidence "..." \\
                       [--owner "..."] [--rotation-days N] [--tag t --tag t]
    sign_credential.py show [<credential-id>]

Why a tool and not a file. `collectors/credential_annotations.json` is the
operator's half of the credential picture, the half no scan can measure, and a
file whose only editor is a text editor stays empty: the scenario then has no
surface at all. This is the one writer, and the page and the keyserver both
call `write()` rather than assembling JSON of their own.

WHAT IS REFUSED, AND WHY EACH REFUSAL IS LOAD-BEARING.

  no purpose      an unsigned credential is the state this exists to end
  no evidence     a purpose nobody can check is a guess that will be read as a
                  fact — the rule `collectors/credential_owners.json` already
                  enforces for membership, for the same reason
  a value-shaped  purpose or evidence that looks like a key. The annotation file
    purpose       is in git; a credential pasted into a "purpose" field would be
                  committed, and no later edit removes it from the history
  an unknown id   the board carries no such credential today, so the signature
                  would describe nothing and hide a typo

`auto` — what the door knows at issue time — is written by the doors and never
by this tool: a re-issue replaces it and leaves `purpose` and `owner` standing.
