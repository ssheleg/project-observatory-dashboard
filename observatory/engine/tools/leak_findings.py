"""A value of ours, seen where it does not belong.

`tools/scan_leaks.py` measures; this decides what reaches the board. The split
matters here more than anywhere else on it: the scanner is allowed to be noisy —
a sighting costs a line — and `leaks.jsonl`, the operator's debt register, is
not. So nothing here writes that register. A hit leaves as a finding carrying the
exact `tools/vault.py leak` command, and a person confirms it.

TWO SEVERITIES, because a text match cannot tell them apart and a name can.
A Cloudflare account id is thirty-two hex characters — shape-identical to a
secret, and public by design. A `*_SECRET`, `*_TOKEN`, `*_KEY` or `*_PASSWORD`
is not. Both are reported; only the second is critical, and the row says why the
first is there at all rather than hiding it.
