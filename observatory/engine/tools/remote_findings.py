"""What production's configuration owes the operator.

`registry/remote-env.json` holds four verdicts per variable and only one of them
is a debt — which is the whole difficulty of this rule set:

`differs` IS THE HEALTHY CASE. A production database URL that equals the one in
a developer's checkout is the accident; one that differs is the design. A rule
firing on `differs` would put hundreds of rows on the board for a system
working exactly as intended, and the board would be ignored by the second day.

So two rules, and both are about a value being in two places it should not be:

`remote.same_as_local`      a production SECRET whose value also sits in a
                            local `.env`. One aggregate row: the remedy is one
                            sentence for every occurrence — give production its
                            own value — and dozens of rows of one sentence is
                            noise, not information.
`remote.retired_still_deployed`
                            production is still holding a value the vault has
                            already rotated away. Critical, one row per slot,
                            and no aggregate: each is a different key at a
                            different provider, and the remedy names it.

And three about what the comparison could not see:

`remote.unbacked`           production secrets that exist only at the provider,
                            with no checkout or vault slot holding a copy.
`remote.namespace_withheld` secrets both sides hold that were fingerprinted
                            under different salts, so no verdict was derived.
`remote.unreadable`         applications whose configuration could not be read,
                            which is unknown rather than empty.

NO TIMESTAMP INSIDE A FINDING: the only dates quoted are the ones the registry
already carries.
