"""What a step ACTUALLY opens, measured by running it — not by reading it.

`tests/test_pipeline.py` orders the two orchestrators against a declared graph:
each step names the files it writes and the files it reads, and two derivations
keep the declaration honest — what the script's source names in four spellings,
and what its command line hands it. Both read TEXT, and both said so: neither
sees a path built into a variable.

Four steps fall entirely into that blind spot. `dashboard`, `validate`,
`scan-events` and `scan-fs` contain no file access either derivation can read,
so their entries rest on the author's word — named in the handoff four
iterations running and deferred every time, which is its own kind of evidence.

This settles them by a third technique: run the step with every path-opening
door wrapped, and write down what came through. Sources are ranked by how much
they can lie:

    read/written by name          measured here
    read through a subprocess     NOT measured — `git` and `node` are opened by
                                  this process but read their own files, and a
                                  wrapper in this interpreter cannot see them
    read by a C extension         NOT measured, for the same reason; sqlite is
                                  wrapped at `connect`, which is the file it opens

So a clean report means "nothing undeclared passed through Python", never
"nothing undeclared happened". That distinction is the whole reason this file
exists rather than a sentence in a docstring saying the four are fine.

    tools/trace_opens.py dashboard              # one step, redirected
    tools/trace_opens.py dashboard validate     # several
    tools/trace_opens.py --all                  # every step the graph declares

**Not a gate step.** It EXECUTES collectors, which take minutes and touch the
estate's checkouts; the invariant it measures moves when a step's code changes,
not when the data does. Run it when a step gains a file access, and when the
graph is edited.
