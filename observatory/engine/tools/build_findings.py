"""Turn measured facts into a list of things that need a person.

WHY THIS EXISTS. The registry can know that domains will expire soon with
auto-renewal off, that domains still paid for resolve nowhere, that published
project homepages are dark, and that branches of real work exist on exactly one
disk — and when every one of those sits in a JSON file that nothing reads on a
schedule, nobody is told. A measurement nobody is told about is not
observability; it is a diary.

WHY A FINDING IS NOT A LEDGER ROW. The ledger is append-only history: what was
observed, by whom, at what revision. A finding is a DERIVED projection over
current facts, and it must be rebuildable — the same rule that governs
`DERIVED_TYPES` in the emitter. Writing findings into the ledger would append
a row per finding on every scan and make history unreadable within a day.

THE ONE THING CARRIED FORWARD is `first_seen`, read from the previous file, so
"open for three months" can be said at all. Delete `findings.json` and every
finding looks new today — an acceptable and stated degradation, not a silent one.

An operator's acknowledgement lives in `collectors/finding_acks.json`, curated
and outside the rebuild, because a value kept only inside a generated file is
lost the first time it is generated again (trap T11).

    it has no folder on this machine, no repository, and no activity date — the

    cannot watch produces no observation, so the ABSENCE of one went unobserved.

    Takes the documents rather than reading them, for one reason: on a healthy
    machine the live pair is `{}` plus a recent run — the good state — so a rule
    that read the files could never be watched doing anything, and every branch
    here covers a state the estate may not have been in yet
    (`tests/test_provider_health.py`).

    `agent/providers.py` stays the only writer of `provider-health.json`. This
    reads it, and the gate's purity verdict is what keeps that true.

    Two subjects, and they are not merged. A QUARANTINED model failed at call
    time and `unhealthy()` re-probes it within the hour, so the remedy is to wait
    and watch. A RETIRED id is one the provider's catalogue no longer lists: the
    chain is permanently shorter until `agent/models.json` is edited. Opposite
    remedies, so opposite findings — a single finding with a mode flag would put
    "wait" and "edit the chain" behind one row.

    `health` is None when the file is absent or unparseable, and that is NOT the
    same as `{}`. `{}` with a recent run means every model answered; `{}` with no
    run means health was never established. Reporting the second as the first is
    the one outcome this repository forbids everywhere else.
