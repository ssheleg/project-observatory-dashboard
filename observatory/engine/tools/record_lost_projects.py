**The problem is where that knowledge lives.** It is in claude-mem — a store this
system opens READ-ONLY and does not own, with its own retention and its own
reasons to prune. The registry cannot hold the fact either: it is derived from
what EXISTS, so an entry with no anchor is wiped by the next emit. So the estate
can currently SAY a project is lost and cannot KEEP it.

The ledger is the one authored, append-only record here, and this writes into it
under the rules that already govern every automated writer:

* `state='proposed'` — an automated writer may not promote its own row, and
  `tools/corroborate.py` sends any kind but `session` to `needs_person`, which
  is right: what a vanished project MEANT is not mechanically checkable.
* `project_id` is NULL, deliberately. The project is not in the registry, and
  minting an id for it would be inventing the thing this record exists to say is
  gone.
* the statement carries measured numbers only — counts, dates, the folder — and
  the `why` says why it is worth keeping at all. No guess about what happened to
  it: a fabricated cause is read as true by everything downstream.
