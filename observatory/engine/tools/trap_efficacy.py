"""Does each trap's guard actually CATCH its trap? Measured by putting it back.

                                                                               
                                                                                
                                                                                 
                                                                                 
                                                                           
                                                              

So this tool re-introduces each defect and watches. One mutation, one guard, two
runs:

* the **control** run, in the same prepared environment, must be GREEN — else
  the environment, not the mutation, is what the guard is answering;
* the **mutated** run must be RED, and its failure is the receipt.

Three outcomes, never two: `CAUGHT`, `MISSED` (the guard cannot catch its own
defect — the finding this tool exists to produce), and `INCONCLUSIVE` (the
control was not green or the guard skipped, so nothing was established).

**Nothing live is mutated except tracked source, and only under a lease.** A
registry or store mutation runs against a COPY through `OBSERVATORY_REGISTRY` /
`OBSERVATORY_DB`, so the operator's data is never touched. Source mutations have
no such redirect: the file is edited in place and restored from git in a
`finally`, and the tool refuses to start unless every file it will touch is
clean, so a restore can never lose work. Acquire the registry lease first — the
tick stands down while it is held, which is what keeps a mutated tree from
reaching a scheduled run.

    tools/trap_efficacy.py             every declared mutation
    tools/trap_efficacy.py T7 T15      only these traps
    tools/trap_efficacy.py --list      what is declared, and what is not

**Not a gate step, deliberately** — the same reasoning as `tools/fresh_clone.py`.
It edits tracked files, so a gate that ran it would be a gate that can leave a
dirty tree; and the invariant it measures moves when a guard is written, not
when the code under it changes. Run it when you add a trap, and when a guard is
rewritten.
