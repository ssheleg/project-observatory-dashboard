"""A control plane for credentials that never carries one.

    tools/keyserver.py            serve on 127.0.0.1, print the URL, stay up
    tools/keyserver.py --port N   a different port
    tools/keyserver.py --once     answer one request and exit (for tests)

WHY THIS EXISTS AND WHY IT IS NARROW. The dashboard is a file read from
`file://`: it can show what is true and it cannot change anything. Minting,
capping and revoking a key are one command each, and a person reading a row
about a key that is about to die should not have to go and assemble that command
by hand. So the page is served here instead, same-origin with a small API.

**THE VALUE NEVER PASSES THROUGH THE BROWSER, and that is the whole design.**

  minting        the provider generates the key, this process writes it straight
                 to its destination file at mode 600. The browser learns a name
                 and a limit and never sees a character of it.
  capping        a number and a reset word.
  revoking       a label — the provider's truncated display form of the key,
                 which is not the key.
  marking a leak free text saying where it was seen.

  revealing      THE ONE EXCEPTION, and it is an exception to "the value never
                 passes through the browser" rather than to any of the rules
                 below. One named variable out of one env file, resolved against
                 `store/raw/env.json` rather than against the path in the
                 request — so this is a reader of a measured inventory, not a
                 file reader that happens to hold a token — audited before the
                 file is opened, with the path, the name and the class in the log
                 and never the value. It exists because the operator owns the
                 machine and the secret; the honest way to offer it is to make it
                 narrow and loud rather than to refuse it and leave them grepping.

  putting or rotating a VAULT secret is REFUSED here. `tools/vault.py`'s
  contract is that a value travels on stdin and nowhere else — not argv, not a
  chat message, and not an HTTP body a browser tab holds in memory and a
  devtools panel replays. The page hands over the command instead. A control
  plane that broke that rule to be convenient would be the largest hole in the
  system it was built to protect.

WHAT GUARDS THE API:

  bound to 127.0.0.1  never a routable address, and refused if asked for one
  a token            in a file at mode 600, required on every API call in a
                     custom header — which also forces a CORS preflight, so a
                     page on another origin cannot post to it blind
  an Origin check    the browser's own statement of who is calling
  an audit line      every action, with what it acted on, appended before the
                     action is attempted — a log written afterwards loses the
                     one case that matters

Only the explicit, authenticated reveal route returns a credential value.
The state route serves metadata from `registry/credentials.json`; mutation
routes return a name, a label and an outcome.
