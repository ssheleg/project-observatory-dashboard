"""The second witness ARCHITECTURE.md promised: check a claim against the world.

    "A `proposed` row is promoted when the operator approves it, or when a
     second, independent scan corroborates it. Nothing else promotes anything."
                                                    — docs/ARCHITECTURE.md:77

Only the first half was even reachable, and nothing called it: forty-three rows
sat proposed until retention would erase them at ninety days. Erasure by timeout
is not review.

WHAT CAN HONESTLY BE CORROBORATED, and what cannot:

* **`session` rows can.** The companion plugin records a repository, a branch and
  the HEAD sha it saw. Asking git, later and independently, whether that sha is
  still an ancestor of that branch is a real second look: it was written from
  `git status`, and this reads the object graph. If the sha is GONE — force-push,
  branch deleted, clone rebuilt — the row is NOT promoted. That is a finding, not
  a corroboration, and pretending otherwise would promote a claim about work that
  no longer exists.

* **`observation` rows cannot, and this refuses rather than pretending.** Their
  evidence is a delta that has already been consumed: `dirty-changed 60 -> 62`.
  Re-reading it proves nothing — the uncommitted-file count moves every hour, and
  a commit count only grows, so "still true" is either meaningless or trivially
  true. Those rows need a person, and the queue says so instead of quietly
  shrinking.
