"""The one door to Cloudflare credentials: stash, issue, rotate, revoke, ping.

    ./tools/cloudflare.py stash            # admin token on stdin, once per account
    ./tools/cloudflare.py issue --preset analytics [--project project:x]
    ./tools/cloudflare.py list
    ./tools/cloudflare.py ping
    ./tools/cloudflare.py rotate <label>   # or --leaked, for every open leak
    ./tools/cloudflare.py revoke <label>

THE ADMIN TOKEN IS STASHED AND NEVER HANDED OUT. It carries write access to
everything the account has — billing, DNS, Workers, and the power to mint more
tokens — so the plugin that reads request counters must never hold it. It lives
in `secrets/cloudflare-admin/` at mode 600 and is read by exactly one thing:
this program, in memory, for the length of one API exchange. Every operational
token is ISSUED from it, narrow, and it is the narrow one that reaches a file a
plugin reads.

WHY A PROGRAM AND NOT A PROCEDURE. The same reasoning the vault was built on:
a rule that a human follows is a rule that holds until the day it is
inconvenient. Values travel on stdin, never in argv, where the shell history,
`ps` and an agent's transcript would all keep them. Nothing here prints a value,
including on error — an exception message that echoes a request header is
exactly how a credential ends up in a transcript.

EVERY ISSUED TOKEN CARRIES ITS OWN RECORD — `<label>.meta.json` beside it, which
holds the account, the purpose, the project it was issued for, and its rotation
history, but never the value. That file is what makes `list`, `ping` and the
credentials projection able to answer "what exists, what reads it, when was it
last rotated" without anyone opening a secret.

ROTATION IS ROLLING, NOT REPLACING. Cloudflare can issue a fresh value for an
existing token id, which keeps the token's identity, its permissions and its
name — so a rotation after a leak changes exactly the thing that leaked, and
nothing downstream has to learn a new name.
