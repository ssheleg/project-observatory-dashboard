"""What shape is a registry record? Derived from the data, never hand-listed.

`AGENTS.md` calls `registry/*.json` "typed facts", and until 2026-09-08 nothing
published those types. `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` documents the store's tables and
the MCP tools; `fabric/schemas/*.json` describe the MCP output shapes; and
`tools/validate_registry.py` checks invariants — ids unique, domains lowercase,
the zone snapshot in step with `domains.json` — not the set of fields a record
carries. The shape lived only in the emitting code and in the data.

So every reader inferred it, and five inferences of mine were wrong inside two
iterations — `c["name"]` for `nwo`, `newest_on` for `unpushed_newest_on`,
`remote_head` where the code compares `branch_sha`, `rel["repository_id"]` for
`from`/`to`, and a bold `Статус:` label for a `- Status:` list item. Each time the
answer sat in a file I had edited minutes earlier. A lesson in the decision log
does not prevent the sixth; this repository's rule for that is a script.

**Generated, and that is the whole design.** A hand-written field table is the
next thing to drift — the lesson here about counts, dates, pointers and prose
alike. This derives the shape FROM the data, so it cannot disagree with it, and
`tools/check_docs.py` fails when the published copy is stale. `docs/AGENT_SYNC.md`
is the precedent: generated, stamped, checked.

**Every field carries how many records hold it.** `local.unpushed` sits on 15 of
177 repositories (measured 2026-09-08, and still exactly that — dated because an
undated true figure becomes an undated false one with nobody touching it), and a
list showing it beside `id` would teach a reader it is
always there — the same false confidence one level up. A count makes optionality
visible without a schema language.

**One level of nesting, no more.** `local` is where every one of my wrong guesses
lived, so it is described; going deeper would produce a document nobody reads
instead of the one page a reader needs. Where a value is a list, the element type
is named rather than walked.
