"""Record what a turn changed in a watched repository. Facts only.

Called by the observatory-log plugin's Stop hook. Standard library only — a hook
is a bad place to discover a missing dependency, so nothing here imports outside
the interpreter.

One record per session, corrected as the work grows: the second turn supersedes
the first by compare-and-swap rather than appending a near-duplicate. `why` is
never written here. The hook cannot know it, and inventing it would be the exact
failure the whole design refuses.

Prints a JSON object on stdout for the hook to act on:
    {"recorded": true, "memoryId": …, "revision": …, "hasWhy": false,
     "project": "project:…", "files": 3, "insertions": 40, "deletions": 5}
Any refusal is `{"recorded": false, "reason": …}` — never a traceback, because
the caller is a hook that must degrade silently.
