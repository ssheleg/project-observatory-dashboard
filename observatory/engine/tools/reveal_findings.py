"""What the keyserver's own journal owes the board.

THE JOURNAL MUST BE READ BACK. `store/logs/keyserver.jsonl` records every
reveal, mint, limit and revoke, and a record that exists so a question can be
answered later is worth nothing if no rule ever asks it. A burst of reveals of a
single variable — the same name read again every few minutes through a night —
is either an agent loop that never keeps the value by name (the
`handling-secrets` rule says work with NAMES after the first read) or a caller
nobody here started; both are the operator's to tell apart, and neither reaches
the operator through a file nothing reads.

TWO RULES, BOTH ABOUT FREQUENCY, NEITHER ABOUT VALUES:

    secret.reveal_burst      one subject revealed >= BURST times in a WINDOW —
                             names the subject, the count, and who asked
    secret.reveal_unnamed    reveals whose caller did not name itself, once
                             the header exists — a count, info,
                             because an old skill copy is the likely cause

The journal holds names and places, never values (keyserver.audit()), so this
module carries nothing it could leak; and it never raises on a journal it
cannot read — an unreadable journal is its own row, not silence.
