"""What the credential inventory owes the operator, on the board rather than a tab.

A TAB ANSWERS A QUESTION SOMEBODY ASKED. These arrive at somebody who did not:
a key whose cap is a lifetime rather than a month dies one day for no visible
reason, and an account nothing claims is one nobody will dare rotate.

`secret.leaked_unrotated` is NOT here: `tools/build_findings.py` already raises
it from the leak register, and two rules over one subject is how a board gets
two rows that mean one thing. This file adds what the register cannot see,
because it reads the register's neighbours instead:

`credential.lifetime_cap`   a limit with no reset. The key works until the
                            total is reached and then stops, long after anyone
                            remembers setting it.
`credential.unclaimed`      nothing says which projects use it. Aggregated:
                            the remedy is one curation pass, not one decision
                            per row.
`credential.untracked`      known only because it leaked: the estate has no
                            record of the credential itself, so rotating it
                            cannot be verified afterwards.
`credential.shared_rotation` one credential, several projects. Not a defect but
                            a fact with a consequence, and the consequence is
                            that rotating it breaks every project at once
                            unless they are deployed together.

NO TIMESTAMP INSIDE A FINDING: every date quoted is a date the registry
already holds, so the same inputs always produce the same rows.
