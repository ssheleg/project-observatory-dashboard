"""Tell someone, once, about a finding that is new or has got worse.

THE HARD PART IS NOT SENDING, IT IS NOT SENDING AGAIN. A notice that fires every
thirty minutes teaches the operator to ignore the channel, and then it is worth
less than silence. Delivery is therefore recorded in the event store under
`kind='finding.notified'` with `ref='<finding id>@<severity>'`, and the schema's
own `events_dedup` UNIQUE(kind, ref) enforces once only: the guarantee lives in
the database, not in this file's control flow. Encoding severity in the ref is
what makes a rise in severity speak again while a steady finding stays quiet.

CHANNEL. macOS notification centre, which needs no credential, no network and no
external service. Sending findings to a chat or a mailbox would be publishing
this machine's private inventory somewhere else, and that is the operator's
decision to make explicitly, not a default for a background tick to take.

`info` findings never notify. They carry no deadline; they belong in the
dashboard and in `observatory_findings`, where they are read on purpose rather
than pushed.
