"""Four things about Heroku that belong on the operator's queue, not on a tab.

A TAB IS NOT A WATCHER. A dashboard tab answers a question somebody asked; a
finding reaches somebody who did not ask. That difference is the whole reason these
rules exist: an app whose web dyno has crashed can go on costing money for months
while the one screen that would show it stays unopened.

FOUR RULES, AND WHAT EACH ONE IS NOT.

`heroku.app_down`          — one row per application, because each is a decision
                             about a different thing. Not aggregated: an
                             operator restarts or deletes them one at a time.
`heroku.paying_for_nothing`— resources billed with no dyno to use them. The
                             severity is `warning` rather than `critical`
                             because nothing is BROKEN; money is leaving, which
                             is a decision, not an incident.
`heroku.orphan_app`        — running, and no project in this registry claims it.
                             ONE aggregate row: nineteen of them today, and
                             nineteen slots of a forty-slot board would be the
                             `clone.stale` defect again. The count is
                             the information; which ones is the tab's job.
`heroku.no_local_clone`    — an application whose source is on no disk here. Also
                             aggregated, and `info`, because it is a fact about
                             this machine rather than about the estate: a laptop
                             is not a backup and never was.

NO TIMESTAMP INSIDE A FINDING: every date these rows quote is a fact
the registry already holds — the day of a deploy — never the moment this ran.

#: How old a snapshot may be before the estate rows stop being built from it.
#: `tools/tick.sh` refreshes the scan when it is older than 24h, so anything past
#: two days means the tick has not run or the scan refused — and rows built from
#: it would describe an estate that was, not one that is. Measured cost of not
#: having this: `emit` rewrites the document on EVERY tick from a raw file only a
