"""Commit the generated registry, or explain why not.

                                                                             
                                                                           
                                                                              
                                                                         
                                    

The sibling's rule was "refuse if anything outside the projection is modified".
That is right for the wiki, where the whole repository is the projection's home
and a dirty file there is probably an abandoned edit. It is wrong here: this
repository is under active development, so it is nearly always dirty, and a
committer that refuses on any dirt never runs.

What actually has to be true is narrower and testable — **the commit must
capture nothing but the registry**:
