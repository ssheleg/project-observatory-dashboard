"""Commit the generated projection in the wiki, under a lease, or explain why not.

The tick rewrites a few files in the wiki on every run and nothing committed
them, so the repository was dirty soon after any commit and the coordination
tool's `finish` step reported it — correctly, because it cannot tell a
generated refresh from an abandoned edit.

Three rules keep a scheduled committer from being worse than the problem:

* **Only the projection.** If anything outside `inventory/` is modified, this
  stops and touches nothing: a scheduled job must never sweep up a human's work
  in progress.
* **Under a lease.** `inventory/` is a guarded path in that repository, and a
  background job is exactly the second writer the lease exists for.
* **Never pushes.** A commit is recoverable locally; a push is the operator's
  decision about what leaves the machine.
