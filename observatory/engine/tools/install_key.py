"""Put an OpenRouter key where its consumer will find it, without anyone seeing it.

    tools/install_key.py --for observatory < protected-key-file
    tools/install_key.py < protected-key-file      # provisioning keys need no --for

WHY THIS EXISTS. Each consumer reads its key from a different place:

    observatory   the store's key file             read by the scheduled tick; a
                                                   shell variable would shadow it,
                                                   and a scheduler passes none
    companion     the memory companion's .env      the only place its worker looks
    provisioning  the secret store                 mints, limits and revokes keys;
                                                   `tools/revoke_key.py` needs it

Telling an operator which file to edit is a chance to pick the wrong one, and a
key pasted into a chat, an argument list or a shell history is a key that has
to be rotated. So: the key arrives on STDIN and nowhere else, this program
decides which kind it is by ASKING the provider rather than by looking at the
prefix — an inference key and a provisioning key are spelled the same — and
writes it mode 600 to the one place that consumer reads.

Nothing here ever prints a key. What it prints is the kind, the length, and
what the provider says the key may spend.

A provisioning key removes a class of interruption: with one on the machine,
keys can be minted, capped and revoked from here; without one, every new key is
a trip to the provider's console.
