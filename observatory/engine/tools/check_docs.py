"""Is the documentation true? — as an exit code, not as a sentence in a report.

Fourteen drifts were found by an audit on 2026-09-06 and every one of them was a
statement that had been true once. `README.md` said the LLM layer was "not built
yet" while the agent had spent real money for three days; `observatory.py`'s own
docstring documented a step that does not exist; `FABRIC-CONFORMANCE.md` sat a
revision behind the manifest it certifies; and `fabric/probes/assertions.md` —
published to any Fabric host that reads it — described three probes when four
run.

Fixing fourteen sentences by hand is one afternoon. The class comes back the
following week, because nothing measures it. So the fixes are what this file
DEMANDS rather than what somebody remembered, and "the docs are in sync" becomes
a command with an exit code.

Every rule is chosen because it is mechanically decidable, and `--list` is the
one place they are enumerated. This docstring deliberately states no count and
no list: it opened with "Five rules" and the numbered five while eleven ran —
a drift inside the drift checker, and the one sentence here that nothing could
measure, since rule 2 reads documents and rule 5 reads named phrases. Removing
the number removes the class instead of the instance.

Rule 5 is the brittle one and it is deliberately narrow: each entry carries the
measurement that killed the claim, so the next reader can tell a retired
sentence from a typo. Rules 10 and 11 read their subject as TEXT rather than as
imported objects, because both defects are invisible once Python has parsed
them — a collapsed duplicate key, and a header that no code consults.
