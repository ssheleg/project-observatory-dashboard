#: Shannon entropy DIVIDED BY its own ceiling, `log2(len)`. The first version
#: used raw bits per character with a floor of 4.3 — and a real AWS key sailed
#: through, because its body is exactly sixteen characters and the maximum
#: entropy of a sixteen-character string is log2(16) = 4.0. The floor was above
#: the ceiling: unreachable by construction, for a shape AWS defines exactly.
#:
#: Normalised, the separation is real. Measured 2026-09-07:
#:
#:     this repository's fixture   0.72      random 32-char body   0.91
#:     'your-key-goes-here…'      0.74      random 48-char body   0.89
#:     'placeholder' x4           0.57      random 64-char body   0.87
#:     'x' x32                    0.00
#:
#: 0.78 sits below every real body's minimum over 4000 draws (0.796 at 48
#: characters, 0.806 at 32) and above every placeholder measured.
NORMALISED_FLOOR = 0.78

#: THE LIMIT OF THE METHOD, and it is why `EXACT_SHAPES` exists. Over 4000 draws
#: a real sixteen-character AWS body's minimum normalised entropy is 0.725 and
#: its first percentile 0.789 — which OVERLAPS the fixture at 0.72 and the
#: placeholder at 0.74. No entropy measure can separate those distributions,
#: because sixteen characters do not hold the information to. So a short,
#: structurally exact vendor shape is decided by its PREFIX and never measured.
MIN_BODY = 24

#: A false positive here costs one allowlist line with a reason; a false negative
#: is a leaked credential.
EXACT_SHAPES = {"aws access key", "google api key"}

#: (name, pattern). Each is a vendor prefix that means "this is a credential"
#: rather than a guess about shape. The generic assignment rule at the end is

#: than an allowlist — it makes every third-party scanner agree too. The

#: carries a truncated placeholder of one, with `MII...` where key material
