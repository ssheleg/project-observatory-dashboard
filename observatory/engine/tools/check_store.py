"""Ask SQLite whether the store is structurally sound, and record the answer.

**Why this exists.** A read can fail with `database disk image is malformed` and
the same pragma answer `ok` minutes later, so nothing about the store is wrong by
the time anyone looks. That transient fault is reported by the code that hits
it — it records the fault, and `events` journals the finding, so a recurrence
leaves a series.

**This checks something else, and says so rather than borrowing that
justification.** Real corruption — a store file with no SQLite header at all —
is otherwise found by a read FAILING, which is to say after it has already
broken a run and left `finding` rows pointing at the wrong cause. A periodic
check finds a damaged store before a reader does.

**The cost, measured on a store of a few tens of MiB, because the figures here
reversed under measurement:**

    PRAGMA quick_check         15 / 15 / 15 ms
    PRAGMA integrity_check    204 / 89 / 87 ms      (first run cold)

The old note read `quick_check 129 ms` against `integrity_check 97 ms` and
concluded "the cheaper pragma is not even cheaper in practice". That is the
benchmark-ordering error: whichever runs first pays for the cold cache. The cheap
pragma is six times cheaper, and the receipt records a still different number —
`took_ms: 1623` — because the tick runs this while its own collectors contend for
the file. Three numbers, three conditions, and the honest form is to name all
three rather than one.

**And the reason given for the choice was the wrong example.** It said the
difference is index CONTENT verification, "exactly the class of damage a reader
would otherwise discover by getting a wrong answer" — while the damage this store
actually recorded was `SQLITE_CORRUPT: vtable constructor failed: search_notes`
(2026-09-08T00:54:56Z, 12.09 GiB free, so not the disk-full episode). Driven
against a planted defect — a copy of the live store with `search_notes_data`
dropped — BOTH pragmas name it:

    quick_check       61 ms  ->  malformed inverted index for FTS5 table main.search_notes
    integrity_check   91 ms  ->  malformed inverted index for FTS5 table main.search_notes

So `integrity_check` is kept for what SQLite documents it to add — verifying that
each ORDINARY index agrees with its table, which `quick_check` skips — and not
for the FTS5 class, which the cheap one catches too. Ninety milliseconds on a
thirty-minute cycle for a strictly larger check is still the right trade; the
evidence for it is now the documentation plus a measurement, rather than a
reversed benchmark.

FOUR verdicts, because three of them are not `ok` for different reasons and a
reader acting on them does different things:

    ok           SQLite verified every page and index
    damaged      it opened and the check reported problems — the detail is
                 SQLite's own text
    unopenable   `file is not a database`; a fact about the FILE, and reporting
                 it as a failed integrity check sends a reader looking for a
                 damaged page in something that has no pages
    absent       there is no store yet, which is a fresh clone rather than a fault

    check_store.py            check and write the receipt
    check_store.py --print    also print the verdict
