That last sentence used to end "and it is exported to the wiki". It was FALSE —
nothing exported it, and `project_into_vault.py` never mentioned it — so the only
copy of every conclusion the agent had drawn lived in this one gitignored file.
It was found corrupt on 2026-09-06 and came back because `.recover` happened to
find the pages intact, which is luck. `tools/export_ledger.py` now writes
`registry/ledger.jsonl` on every tick, and the claim above is true of that file.

    a launchd tick and a manual run landing in the same second is exactly what
