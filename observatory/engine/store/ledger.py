"""The canonical write path: append only, guarded by compare-and-swap, operator protected.

Three rules the rest of the system leans on:

1. **Revisions are immutable.** A change of content OR of state appends a new
   revision that supersedes the prior one. Nothing rewrites a row, so
   `contested` and `stale` are recoverable history rather than a lost argument.
2. **The owner guard is structural.** It is applied on every write, not passed
   as a parameter — an optional guard with a default of `operator` lets an
   unnamed writer claim the highest authority simply by saying nothing.
3. **No index write without a committed revision.** The ledger append and its
   outbox row are one transaction; indexers consume the outbox idempotently.
   SQLite and a vector index cannot share a transaction, so the outbox is what
   keeps the two consistent: an index can lag the ledger, never lead it.
