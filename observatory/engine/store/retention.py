"""What leaves the store, and the audit trail it leaves behind.

**Retention never DELETEs a ledger row.** It writes a tombstone, then purges the
derived projections and records that the purge happened. An erasure with no audit
trail is indistinguishable from a bug, and the opposite mistake is just as real:
machine-written `proposed` rows accumulate on every sweep until something prunes
them.

Two guards are structural rather than configurable, because each is a rule
something else depends on:

* **Operator rows are exempt under every state and every age.** The guard lives
  in the SQL, not in a caller's flag — an optional guard is one that is
  eventually forgotten.
* **`superseded` is never pruned.** It is what a correction's `supersedes`
  points at, and dropping it turns an audit chain into a dangling reference.

**WHAT A TOMBSTONE REMOVES, AND WHAT IT KEEPS.** Stated here because it is the
one thing a reader will act on, and measured 2026-09-07 rather than reasoned:

    canon (the `ledger` table)     KEPT      — deliberately; the row IS the trail
    `ledger.live()`, the read path gone
    the lexical index              gone
    the vector index               gone
    `registry/ledger.jsonl`        KEPT      — and that file is COMMITTED

So a tombstone makes a revision unREADable, not unRECOVERABLE. The store's bytes
are hardened too (`secure_delete` and a VACUUM, so no freed page holds the text of
an index copy), and that is a narrower claim than it sounds beside the word
"erasure": the canonical row keeps its statement, the export mirrors canon, and
git history keeps the export for ever.

If text must be unrecoverable rather than unreadable, a tombstone is not the
mechanism and this project deliberately does not have one: revisions are
immutable, so nothing here may rewrite one, and the audit trail was chosen over
forgetting. `registry/ledger.jsonl`'s own header says the same thing, because
that is the file somebody will read.
