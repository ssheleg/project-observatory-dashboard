-- STATE rather than a measurement: nothing here is a fact about the estate, so
-- nothing here belongs in `observations`, which retention keeps only three of.
--
-- The first cursor exists because `compute_deltas diff` decided what to compare
-- from timestamps alone and therefore could not tell what it had already
-- compared. Two live consequences, both measured 2026-09-07: a repeated `diff`
-- wrote the same delta twice (three such rows in the live store, all still
-- pending, so the agent would have read one change twice), and a SKIPPED diff
-- lost a generation outright — three snapshots and one diff produced deltas for
-- the last pair only, and the command printed a confident "2 delta(s) written"
-- while a rename in the middle generation became nothing at all.
--
-- Inferring it from `deltas.to_scan` instead would have worked until retention
-- deleted the consumed rows it was inferred from. A cursor is small, durable,
-- and says what it means.
