"""Schema-compatible data migrations, applied once and recorded.

`store/schema.sql` creates the shape. This file fixes CONTENT that a past
version wrote wrongly — which schema DDL cannot express and which a one-off
script nobody remembers to run does not fix either. Each migration is named,
idempotent, and recorded in a `migrations` table, so `db.connect()` can apply
what is outstanding and skip what is done with a single SELECT.

The first one exists because of a defect measured on 2026-09-06: 8,249 of 9,013
`events.occurred_at` values carried a local offset — `+02:00`, `+03:00`,
`+01:00`, `-05:00` — because `collectors/scan_events.py` took git's `%cI`
verbatim while every other writer in this store wrote UTC `Z`.

**Why that is a correctness bug and not a formatting one.** The column is TEXT
and every comparison over it is lexicographic: `survey.timeline` orders and
windows with `ORDER BY occurred_at DESC` and `occurred_at >= ?`, and
`store/retention.py` prunes with `occurred_at < '…Z'`. In that ordering
`+` (0x2B) sorts before `-` (0x2D) sorts before `Z` (0x5A) — so for one and the
same instant the three shapes sort into three different places, "what happened
last week" is wrong by up to 26 hours across the offset boundary, and the
retention cutoff is off by a timezone.
