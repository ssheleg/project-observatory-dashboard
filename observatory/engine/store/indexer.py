"""Build the derived projections: a vector index and a lexical one.

**These carry no canonical meaning.** Losing them is a rebuild, never a data
loss — which is why `rebuild` exists and is tested, rather than being a comment
promising it would work.

The outbox is what makes this safe. A ledger append and its outbox row are one
transaction, so this consumes the outbox rather than scanning the ledger: no
index write can precede a committed revision, and the work is idempotent by
(memory_id, revision, projection_version) so a crash mid-run costs one repeat
and nothing else.
