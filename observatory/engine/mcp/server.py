"""Project Observatory — stdio MCP server.

Protocol revision: 2026-07-28 (written down here and in fabric-agent.json; the
`mcp` SDK 2.x declares it as LATEST_PROTOCOL_VERSION — 1.x tops out at an older
revision and cannot satisfy the manifest, which pins the revision as a schema
`const`).

2026-07-28 is stateless and discovers through `server/discover` rather than an
`initialize` handshake; `sampling`, `roots` and `logging` are deprecated in it.
None of that is reconstructed here — the SDK owns the wire, and this file owns
the tools.

Seven tools read. Two write, and they write only PROPOSALS: `observatory_record`
appends to the append-only ledger in state `proposed`, and
`observatory_propose` queues a registry change without touching
`registry/*.json`. Neither can approve its own proposal, and neither invents a
caller identity — `owner` is required and has no default, because the gateway
owns identity and a memory kernel that manufactures it has none.

The shebang points at the project venv on purpose: the declared tenancy is one
operator on one machine, and the manifest's `executableRef` names this file
directly. Run `./observatory.py setup` on a fresh clone to create it.

# rendering capability, no resource concept and no pagination, so inventing an
# `estate.render` capability would be inventing contract surface — and a host
# compiling this manifest would find a capability the contract cannot describe.
# What the MCP protocol DOES define is resources with URI templates, which is
# exactly the addressable per-subject shape a renderer needs: one URI, one
# subject, a declared media type. `fabric/FABRIC-CONFORMANCE.md` records that
# these are protocol surface and NOT part of the pinned contract, because
# implying contract coverage would be the more expensive lie.
