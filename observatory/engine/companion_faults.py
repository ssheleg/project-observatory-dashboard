"""Which turns the companion could not record, kept where the next turn cannot take them.

`store/raw/record-turn.json` is a SLOT: one document, describing the last turn
the companion handled. Every Stop hook of every watched project on this machine
writes it, and forty-nine Claude processes were running when that was counted
. So a fault written at 10:04 lasts until any of them ends a turn —
including a turn that succeeded, in a project the fault had nothing to do with.

The board is rebuilt every 1800 seconds. `companion.not_recording` therefore
fired only for a fault that happened to be the newest turn on the whole machine
at the moment the tick ran. The incident that produced that rule survived
because it was PERMANENT — roughly seventy-two consecutive turns of one session
raised the same `IllegalTransition` — and the class this machine
actually suffers is the opposite: ten transient database errors in a single day,
42 `No space left` inside one tick.

**Three properties, and they are the whole design.**

1. **Pure append.** One `open(..., "a")`, one `write`. No read-modify-write:
   `store_faults.py` already argued this for the same hazard — reading the file
   back to trim it "is both a second chance to fail and a way to lose a
   concurrent writer's line". A carry-forward inside the slot would have been
   smaller code and would have lost exactly the fault it kept: session A reads
   no-fault, session B writes a fault, session A writes its document over it.

2. **It cannot raise.** `append()` returns the row or `None`. This runs inside
   an `except` block in a hook that must not fail the session it observes.

3. **The reader caps and says so.** A systemic fault is 49 sessions times every
   turn, so the tail is bounded here and the count reaching the board is a
   floor when the bound is hit. At roughly 200 bytes a line, the worst
   incident measured on this machine — 72 turns, one session — is 15 KB; the
   same fault across every session at once is under a megabyte a day. When that
   becomes a growth problem the purge belongs in `store/retention.py` beside
   every other one, not in this writer.

**An unreadable line is COUNTED, not skipped.** `store_faults.recent()` steps
over a torn line silently, and that is defensible where it lives: those faults
are written one at a time, by one process, on a path that is already failing.
Here the writers are concurrent by design, so a line nobody can parse is a
plausible outcome rather than a curiosity — and a count that quietly omits it
understates the exact thing it exists to report.
