"""How many bytes each project's working tree costs, as a metric over time.

The reference plugin. It exists to be copied, so it does the smallest honest
thing: walk each project's local folders, skip what is machine-generated, print
one JSON row per project on stdout, and write nothing anywhere.

`.git` is excluded on purpose. A repository's history is not what the working
tree costs, it does not shrink when files are deleted, and a project that
rewrote its history would look as though it had freed space it never used.
`node_modules`, `.venv` and their kin are excluded for the opposite reason: they
are reinstallable, so counting them measures the package manager rather than the
project. What they cost is reported separately, as `disk.reclaimable_bytes`.

    **The question the footprint metric cannot answer.** `disk.bytes` excludes
    `node_modules`, `.venv`, `build` and their kin, correctly: counting them
    measures the package manager rather than the project. But
    `host.disk_low` — the critical finding that says the volume is nearly full —
    reads that metric to name who is responsible, and the footprint can account
    for a small fraction of what the project folders occupy while most of the
    rest is reclaimable. The finding would be asking "why is my disk full" while
    reading the answer to "what does this project cost".

    So this is its own metric, with its own meaning: what can be deleted and got
    back by reinstalling.

    It descends into each pruned directory rather than counting only the files
    directly inside it: `node_modules` is deeply nested, and a shallow count
    measures the instrument instead of the disk.
