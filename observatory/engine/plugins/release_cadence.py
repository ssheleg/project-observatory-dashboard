"""Whether a project has ever shipped anything, and how long ago.

The estate answers what a project IS, how big it is, whose code it depends on,
and when work last happened. **Nothing said the work resulted in anything.**
`last_activity_on` is a commit or a session; a portfolio of about 120 projects
needs the other question — did this go anywhere — and for that a tag is the
cheapest honest signal a checkout can give.

MEASURED BEFORE THIS WAS WRITTEN, because a metric that is a field of zeros is
machinery without a question. On one installation roughly a third of the
checkouts held tags and the rest held none, with a few carrying no measurement
at all — the tagged and untagged counts need not sum to the total, and the gap
is the honest part, because a checkout the plugin could not read is neither
tagged nor untagged. The tagged ones were mostly packages versioned
continuously, several of them tagged within the same week. A split like that is
a signal; a handful out of a hundred would not have been.

TWO METRICS, AND THE SECOND ONE'S ABSENCE CARRIES INFORMATION.

    release.tags             how many tags the checkout holds
    release.days_since_last  days since the NEWEST tag — omitted entirely where
                             there are none, because 0 would mean "released
                             today", the opposite of never (the same rule that
                             omits a value rather than zeroing it elsewhere)

WHY `for-each-ref` AND NOT `git log --tags`. An annotated tag carries its own
date, and that is the release's date: the commit it points at may be far older —
a release cut from a stabilised branch is exactly that shape. `git log
--no-walk --tags` reads the COMMIT's date and would report the work rather than
the release. The lightweight case falls back to the commit date, which is the
only date such a tag has.

A tag is not a release everywhere: some repositories tag nightlies, some tag
nothing and publish from a branch. That is why the metric is named for what it
MEASURES — tags — rather than for what it is used to infer.
