"""How many local branches each project's checkouts hold.

**Written from `plugins/README.md` alone, as an experiment, and the first draft
inlined two canonical paths because the document never said otherwise.** It
resolved the estate root as `Path.home() / "DATA"` and the registry as the
relative string `"registry/projects.json"` — both of which the repository has
resolvers for, both of which `tools/check_paths.py` missed, and neither of which
the README mentions. The document and the gate were fixed in the same change
.
