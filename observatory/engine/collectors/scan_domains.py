"""Ask DNS and RDAP what is actually true of every domain the registry names.

WHY. `registry/domains.json` marks domains `ownership: owned`, and every field in
it can be a transcription of documents from one day — a registrar CSV export, a
table pasted from the DNS provider. Nothing had ever been measured. A domain that
expired, was transferred, or was put on registrar hold would go on reading
`owned` forever, and most of them carry `auto_renew: false`.

That is not a one-domain problem, though that is how it gets found: a domain
can turn out to be registered at a registrar nobody listed — and, far more
usefully, be on `client hold` and resolve nowhere, while the registry presents
it as a project's homepage.

WHAT IT DOES NOT DO. It never overwrites what the operator transcribed. Measured
facts land in `live` and `rdap`; where they disagree with the transcription the
disagreement is NAMED, not resolved. A collector that silently corrected the
operator would destroy the only record of what was believed and when.

Credential-free: public DNS and public RDAP. Not part of the thirty-minute tick.
