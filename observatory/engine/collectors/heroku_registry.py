"""Turn what Heroku said into typed records, and tie each one to a project.

TWO JOBS, AND THE SECOND IS THE HARD ONE.

The first is arithmetic: a scan row becomes a registry record with a derived
`state`, so that "is this thing running" is answered in ONE place rather than
re-derived by every reader. Five states, and the pairs that look alike are the
reason there are five: `suspended` is Heroku's decision and `down` is the
application's own crash; `resources-only` pays for a database with no dyno and
`idle` pays for nothing.

The second is the link, and AGENTS.md rule 2 governs it: **never infer from a
name.** An app can deploy from a folder with an unrelated name, or from a
monorepo while a folder carrying the app's own name sits beside it with a remote
to the same application. A name-match gets both wrong and looks confident doing
it. So a link is made only where something was MEASURED, and every link carries
the rule that made it:

  `heroku-github-link`  Heroku's own Deploy tab names a repository, and the
                        registry already ties that repository to a project.
  `heroku-remote`       a folder holds `git.heroku.com/<app>.git` in its
                        `.git/config`, and the registry already ties that folder
                        to a project.
  `heroku-remote-nested` the same, for a checkout that sits INSIDE a folder the
                        registry ties to a project — containment on disk, which
                        is measured, not a name that looks similar.
  `verified`            a human resolved it and left the evidence in
                        `collectors/heroku_links.json` — the mechanism rule 2
                        names for the cases measurement cannot reach.

An application no rule reaches is UNLINKED and says so. That is a finding, not a
gap to paper over with a guess: five of them are applications whose source lives
in a GitHub account this machine cannot read.
