"""Every credential this estate holds, as typed facts, and who may use it.

WHY A REGISTRY DOCUMENT AND NOT A SECOND VAULT. `tools/vault.py` holds VALUES
and does it well: mode 600 in the machine's secret store, stdin only, and an
encrypted backup on its own timer. What it cannot do is answer estate
questions: which projects share one hosting account, what has leaked and not
been rotated, which OpenRouter key the tick is actually spending.
Those are facts about what EXISTS, which is what `registry/` is for, and the
split is the same one this repository draws everywhere: values in the store,
facts in git, never the reverse.

**Nothing here is a secret and the shape enforces it.** A record carries a name,
a provider, the provider's own label (a truncated form that the provider itself
calls the key by, not the key), a limit, a date. `tools/check_secrets.py` reads
every tracked file including this one on every gate run.

MANY-TO-MANY, because one account serves several projects and one project uses
several accounts. The edge is `credential_used_by`, from a credential to a
project, and a credential with three projects has three edges, not one field
with a list, so the same query answers both directions.

WHERE THE EDGE COMES FROM, in order:

  measured   a vault slot is `projects/<project>/<env>/<NAME>`, so the project
             is the path; an OpenRouter key's `serves` names its consumer
  curated    `collectors/credential_owners.json`, for a SHARED account no path
             can express, such as one DNS login used by several projects. Every
             row carries its evidence, and a row without one is refused, which
             is the same rule `collectors/heroku_links.json` follows

An account nothing claims stays unclaimed and says so. Guessing which projects
use a shared login from its name is exactly the inference AGENTS.md rule 2
forbids, and here it would be worse than usual: the wrong answer sends somebody
to rotate a credential several projects are quietly using.

    A leak can be against a secret the vault does not hold: it is recorded where
    it was SEEN (a database URL in an app's config, an access secret pasted
    somewhere) and nobody had put it into the store. Without this the board
    carries `secret.leaked_unrotated` for a credential the registry cannot show,
    which is the worst of both: a debt with no subject.
