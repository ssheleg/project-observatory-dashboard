"""The env inventory as a registry document: names, states, and who shares what.

`collectors/scan_env.py` measures; this decides what of that measurement is a
FACT the estate keeps. The division is the same one `heroku_registry.py` draws,
and it exists because the scan holds one thing the registry may never receive:
the salted fingerprint under every value. That fingerprint answers "are these
two the same secret", and the answer, not the fingerprint, is what belongs in
the registry.

THREE QUESTIONS THIS DOCUMENT EXISTS TO ANSWER.

  what does this project hold      per file, per variable, by class
  what would break if I rotate it  `shared_with`, measured rather than curated
  where can I get one              `available_in`, for a slot still empty here

The second is the one that could not be answered before. `collectors/
credential_owners.json` asks an operator to DECLARE which projects share an
account, and the honest answer was that nobody remembers. Two files holding one
value is that declaration, measured, and the finding rule says so, pointing at
the curation file rather than replacing it: a fingerprint proves two values are
equal, not that they are the same ACCOUNT, and an operator still owns that step.
