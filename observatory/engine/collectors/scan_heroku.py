"""Ask Heroku what is actually running, and what it costs to leave it running.

WHY. The registry knows what a project IS (repositories, folders, commits) and
nothing about where it is HOSTED. A crashed dyno, an application Heroku has
suspended, or an application whose whole content is a database nobody deploys
to are all facts about projects this repository already watches, and none of
them can reach a finding rule unless a collector records them.

WHAT IT DOES NOT DO. It never decides which project an application belongs to.
It records what Heroku says (the GitHub repository the Deploy tab is wired to,
and the application's own name) and `collectors/merge.py` ties that to a
project through a repository or a folder the registry ALREADY owns. Inferring a
project from an application's name is a guess the repository rules forbid, and
it is often wrong: an application's name need not match the repository it
deploys from.

CREDENTIALS. The token comes from `heroku auth:token` at run time and is never
written anywhere: not to the raw file, not to the registry, not to a log. The
CLI already holds the operator's session; this borrows it for one process.

DEGRADATION. Four things can go wrong and each is NAMED rather than swallowed:
the CLI is absent, the CLI is not logged in, the API refuses, or one application
answers 403 because Heroku SUSPENDED it. The last one is the reason this file
does not treat an error as an empty list: a suspended application returns 403
on `/dynos`, and reading that as "no dynos" turns "Heroku turned this off" into
"scaled but never started", which is a different diagnosis with a different
remedy.
