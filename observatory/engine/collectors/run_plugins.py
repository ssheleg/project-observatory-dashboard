"""Run every metric plugin, and refuse what they should not have written.

                                                                                
                                                                              
                                                                              
                                                                           

It is not one. The registry answers what EXISTS, is validated, lives in git and
is rewritten whole on every emit. A measurement taken at an instant accumulates
and belongs beside `events`. Once metrics live in the store, nothing downstream
has to learn a plugin's name — and a new source is two files in `plugins/`.

What this runner owes each plugin, and each plugin's readers:

* **A missing requirement is a SKIP with its reason, never a failure.** The rule
  every collector here follows (AGENTS.md, rule 7).
* **Isolation.** A plugin that crashes, hangs or floods is reported; the others
  still run.
* **Refusal, counted.** A row naming a metric the manifest does not declare, or
  a project the registry does not hold, or a timestamp that is not UTC `Z`, is
  rejected and reported. A plugin that can write any name is a plugin whose
  output nobody can check.
* **Idempotence.** `(project_id, metric, at)` is the key: re-measuring a period
  replaces rather than duplicates.
