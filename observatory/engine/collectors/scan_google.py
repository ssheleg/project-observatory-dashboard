"""Every Google surface this machine's service accounts can see.

    scan_google.py store/raw/google.json [--force] [--max-age-hours N]

WHY. The estate's traffic lives in Google Analytics and its search visibility in
Search Console, and until now the observatory read FIVE properties — the five a
hand-written mapping file named. The operator had meanwhile added one service
account as an editor to every analytics account they own, so the honest number
was thirty-eight across four accounts: thirty-three properties were invisible to
a system whose whole job is to say what exists (measured 2026-09-14).

WHAT IT READS, AND WHAT IT NEVER WRITES. One pass per credential:

  * `accountSummaries` — accounts and properties, with their display names;
  * `dataStreams` per property — the web hosts and the app bundle ids the
    property itself declares. This is what makes the project match MEASURED
    rather than declared: a web stream's host goes through the same
    `plugins/hostmap.py` join the rest of the estate uses;
  * one 30-day report per property — active users, sessions, views. Thirty days
    because the question is "is this alive", and a day's number on a small
    property is noise;
  * Search Console's site list per credential.

The credential is read to sign a JWT and never leaves this process; what is
written is the account's own `client_email` — a public identifier, the thing an
operator grants and revokes — never the key, never a token, never a raw
response body.

WHY IT IS CACHED. Thirty-eight properties is seventy-six HTTPS calls and about
a minute; a dashboard that asked Google on every build would be slow, rate
limited, and no more correct — analytics settle daily. The scan refuses to
re-fetch inside the age window and says so; `--force` is the refresh button's
path, and `./observatory.py google --force` is the operator's.
