"""List a Bitbucket workspace, or say precisely why it could not be listed.

                                                                       

                                                                   
                                                        
                                                                                  

The 200 is not access. Anonymous listing returns only PUBLIC repositories, and
this workspace has none, so the endpoint answers and reveals nothing. That is
worth writing down because a status code alone reads like coverage.

So the sixteen repositories under `mobyrix` are known from one thing only: a
local clone points at them. Their default branch and whether the checkout is
current come from `scan_remotes.py`, which needs no credential. Everything else
— description, visibility, language, dates, and above all **repositories that
were never cloned to this machine** — needs the API, and this collector is what
uses it the moment a credential exists.

                                                                                
                                                                                
                         

    username:app_password     -> HTTP Basic  (also the shape of an API token,
                                 which Bitbucket sends as email:token)
    <token>                   -> Bearer

An absent credential is a STATE, not a failure: the collector writes an empty
listing with a named degradation and exits 0, because launchd would otherwise
retry a missing file forever.
