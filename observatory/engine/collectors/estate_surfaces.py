"""Two projections about what the estate OWNS and how it GROUPS: zones and products.

`registry/cloudflare-zones.json`: every Cloudflare zone the estate holds a
token for, joined to the domain registry (registered where?), to the projects
(whose surface?) and to the operator's boundary file (ruled outside? pending?).
It is the answer to "which domains do we have and what is their status" that a
hand-transcribed `domains.json` could only give for the domains it was told about.

`registry/products.json`: several projects, folders and domains that are ONE
THING to a user: a site, its admin, its app, its wiki. Curated rows come from
`collectors/products.json` and are facts; SUGGESTED rows are derived here from
projects that share a registrable domain and are labelled so, because an
inference that looks like a decision gets acted on as one.

Both are read by the dashboard and mirrored into the wiki like every other
projection; neither holds a value of any kind.
