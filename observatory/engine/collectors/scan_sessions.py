"""Where work was DONE, not only where it was committed.

**The defect this closes.** `last_activity_on` is the max of a repository's
GitHub `pushed_at`, its local `last_commit`, and a folder's mtime
(`collectors/merge.py`): every source a git fact. So a project worked on
without a commit is invisible, and `activity.py` then calls it `cooling` or
`dormant` on that silence. The companion session store on one machine held
thousands of session summaries across dozens of project names, and a fair share
of the names that matched a project had sessions NEWER than the registry's last
recorded activity.

**That total is not this collector's own `counts.sessions`, and the difference is
the window.** `window_days` is 365, so the report reads fewer sessions than the
store holds. Two right answers to "how much work", and the README names which is
which. Projects were labelled `cooling` while work went on in them for months.

**It reads somebody else's store, read-only, and says so when it cannot.**
The companion database belongs to the claude-mem plugin. This opens it
`mode=ro`, never writes, and when it is absent or unreadable the result carries
the reason in `degraded` rather than an empty list of sessions: an empty list
would read as "no work happened anywhere", which is the opposite claim.

**Attribution is a declared rule, not a guess.** claude-mem stores a plain
`project` string, derived from the working directory, not a `project:<slug>` id.
The rules below are tried in order and the one that matched is recorded on every
session, so a wrong attribution can be argued with. Names that match nothing are
counted and listed in `degraded`: a sizeable share usually matches nothing, and
that is a fact about the estate worth seeing rather than a silence.

**Sessions are recorded for EVERY matched project, including third-party
clones**, and that is a deliberate departure from `estate.records_events()`.
That rule excludes a third-party clone because *"a third-party clone's commits
are somebody else's history"*: true of a commit, whose author is external, and
false of a session. A session in that clone happened because the operator sat
down and worked in it. Sessions in a third-party checkout are this operator's
attention, and "where was work done" is the question this project exists to
answer.

#:
#: The rule was: a name matching no project, whose work touched exactly one
#: folder the registry holds, belongs to that project. It looked like a
#: measurement rather than a guess about a name. It is not. Contact is not
#: ownership, and the live data said so:
#:
#:   * the sessions of a LOST project were credited to a notes vault, because
#:     that work read a reference note in it;
#:   * a skill's sessions were credited to the family repository the work
#:     happened to sit beside, while the registry held the skill's own project.
#:
#: Without the measurement, the rule would have silently given one project the
#: sessions of another's work: the misattribution this collector exists to
#: prevent, one source over. The classification below is evidence and stays; the
#: decision it informs is the operator's.

    free. `INSERT OR IGNORE` is the same discipline `collectors/scan_events.py`
    uses for commits.

    `actor` is `operator`, and that word carries NO authority here: `events` is
    a measured stream, not the ledger, and the field describes who did the work
    rather than who may approve anything. `project_week.authors` counts distinct

    a rollup; verified before writing rather than after.
