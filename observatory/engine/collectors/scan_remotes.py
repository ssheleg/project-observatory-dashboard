"""Ask every remote whether the local checkout is still current — no credential.

WHY THIS IS NOT A FORGE-SPECIFIC COLLECTOR. It was first reached for to fill
in repositories whose forge metadata is empty because no API token exists. But
the useful half of what SSH gives belongs to no single forge: across every
repository with a local clone, NONE recorded whether that clone had fallen
behind its remote. `local` held the checked-out branch, the commit count, the
last local commit and the uncommitted-file count — every one of them a fact
about the copy, none about the original. Building this under one forge's
collector would have hidden a machine-wide gap inside one forge's ticket.

WHAT IT COSTS AND WHAT IT REFUSES TO DO. One `git ls-remote` per repository,
run concurrently. It **never fetches**: a fetch would write objects into the
operator's repository, and an observatory that mutates what it observes is not
one. The price is that `behind` and `diverged` cannot always be told apart —
distinguishing them needs the remote commit locally.

**But the half of that question worth paying for is answerable anyway**, from
`refs/remotes/origin/<branch>` the clone already holds: whether there are
commits here that the remote did not have at the last fetch — work that would
die with the disk. So the ambiguous case splits into `stale` and
`unpushed-and-remote-moved`, and `behind-or-diverged` is kept for the one place
nothing local can answer it: no tracking ref to ask.

Not part of the thirty-minute tick: it is the only collector that makes a
network call per repository, and staleness does not change minute to minute.

    Asked of `refs/remotes/origin/<branch>` — a ref the clone ALREADY holds, so
    no network call and, more to the point, no write into a repository this
    system only watches. That is what makes it askable at all: the caller's
    refusal to fetch is about mutating the subject, not about the question.

    Three answers, and the third is why this can return None: with no tracking
    ref the question genuinely needs a fetch, and the caller then keeps its old
    honest ambiguity instead of guessing a direction.

    What it does NOT claim: that the CURRENT remote lacks these commits. The ref
    is as old as the last fetch, and a force-push could have rewritten what came
    after it. The finding says "as of the last fetch" for that reason.
