"""`registry/remote-env.json` — what production holds, as verdicts only.

THE DIVISION OF LABOUR IS THE POINT. `scan_remote_env.py` holds the
fingerprints and lives in `store/raw/`, which is gitignored; this module reads
them, compares, and writes WORDS. Four of them:

    same_as_local   production and the checkout hold the same value
    differs         both hold the name, the values are not equal
    remote_only     production has a variable the checkout does not
    local_only      the checkout has one production does not

and a fifth that is honest rather than tidy — `not_compared`, for a variable
both sides hold whose class is not `secret`: the local inventory fingerprints
secrets only (two projects agreeing that `APP_ENV` is `production` is a
coincidence of vocabulary, not a shared credential), so there is nothing to
compare against. Printing "same" there would be a guess.

Two more states exist for the same reason. `no_local_checkout` marks an app
whose source is not on this disk, so nothing can be compared at all. And a
secret both sides hold is also `not_compared`, with a `why`, when the two scans
did not fingerprint under the same salt (`fingerprint_namespace`): equal values
would not produce equal fingerprints, so any verdict would be invented.

`differs` IS THE ORDINARY CASE AND NOT A FINDING. A production database URL
should not equal the one in a developer's checkout. What is worth a row is the
opposite: `same_as_local` on a secret — production running the value that also
sits in a local `.env` — and a value production still holds that the vault has
already rotated away.
