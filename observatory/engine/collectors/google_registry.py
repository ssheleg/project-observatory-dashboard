"""`registry/google-properties.json` — every analytics property, joined to a project.

THE JOIN IS MEASURED BEFORE IT IS DECLARED, which is what changed on 2026-09-14.
A hand-written mapping file named five properties; the service account could see
thirty-eight, and GA4 itself knows what each one is about — every property
declares its web streams (a host) and its app streams (a bundle id). So the
first question is no longer "what did somebody write down" but "what does the
property say it measures", and the host goes through `plugins/hostmap.py`, the
same join the domains and the Cloudflare zones already use.

FIVE RULES, IN EVIDENCE ORDER, and each row carries the one that made it:

    declared     the operator's `plugins/config/ga4_properties.json` — a human
                 decision outranks a measurement, and it is how a property whose
                 host this estate does not own gets attached anyway
    stream-host  a web stream's host resolves to a project through the registry
    app-id       an app stream's bundle id ends in a project's own name, exactly
    name         the property's display name IS a project's name or folder
    —            nothing matched, and the row says so

WHAT AN UNMATCHED PROPERTY MEANS — the operator's own rule, first given for
Cloudflare zones and the same here: a property with no project in this registry
is a product somebody else runs, or one this operator is not working on. It is
not a defect; the board states the count once and names them, and the answer is
a line in the mapping file or nothing at all.
