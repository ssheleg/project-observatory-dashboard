"""How quiet a project has gone — measured, and separate from what it declares.

`lifecycle` answers a DECLARED question: has the owner marked this finished. It
had two values in practice, `active` on 156 projects and `archived` on 3 (measured 2026-09-08; 153 and 3
when this was written), and
the second came only from every repository carrying GitHub's `isArchived` flag.
Nothing anywhere held a staleness threshold, so a project untouched for **3,954
days** — nearly eleven years — was `lifecycle: active`, truthfully, because
nobody had archived it. The registry could say what its projects claimed and not
what they were doing.

This is the other axis, and it stays a separate field for the reason this
codebase keeps rediscovering: a field that answers two questions answers neither.
A project can be archived and have moved last week; another can be unarchived and
untouched for a decade. Both facts are true, and both are worth reading.

The thresholds live in `collectors/activity_tiers.json` so the operator can move
them in one place — the same shape as `store/retention.json`, which the collector
and the pruner both read after they spent a live tick undoing each other.
