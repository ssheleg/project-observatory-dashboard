# Next interface improvements for the full engine

The full engine already generates ten local pages, including project, metric and
finding views. The earlier portable overview remains a separate compatibility UI.
This plan improves the full instrument; it does not describe it as an empty shell.
The scenario contract is [full-engine scenarios](../../observatory/engine/docs/ux/portable-scenarios.md).

## Completed in this release

Copied commands resolve the selected workspace, Python executable and installed
engine. Paths and arguments are quoted, local environment actions avoid printing
values, scheduler actions select the workspace, and obsolete command flags were
removed. `test_dashboard_portability.py`, page and renderer suites cover these
boundaries. Public landing/article/mobile checks are in [DEPLOY.md](../site/DEPLOY.md).

## Ordered implementation packets

| Packet | User problem and change | Done conditions |
|---|---|---|
| UX1 Coverage first | Missing, stale and unconfigured inputs compete with genuine findings. Put coverage and last observation beside status. | New/empty/partial/stale fixtures have a clear next action; unobserved never means healthy; source timestamp and scope visible. |
| UX2 Safe command handoff | Users need to understand copied commands before running them. Explain read vs mutation, workspace and external effects beside the action. | Every action has scope, expected outcome and failure recovery; keyboard copy works; no value is placed in DOM or copied text except an explicitly authorized reveal surface. |
| UX3 Cross-page continuity | A finding should preserve project/filter context when drilling into evidence and returning. | Addressable state, working Back, consistent labels, empty result vs unobserved distinction; no lost keyboard focus. |
| UX4 Dense data | Larger estates need readable tables, search and meaningful grouping. | Synthetic 200-project fixture at 320/768/1440px; stable sort, accessible names, headers and table alternative for charts; no horizontal overflow for the main task. |
| UX5 Onboarding in the instrument | Agent-led setup needs a clear in-product view of what is connected. | Per-integration disabled/unconfigured/connected/error states; minimum required access explained; no keys in chat or default remote scans. |
| UX6 Upgrade confidence | A user should see the active version, pending migration and snapshot location. | Preview differs clearly from apply; stopped-writer requirement visible; restore opens a separate home; unsupported version explains the recovery path. |

Implement each packet through scenarios, copy and design before delivery. Use only
synthetic fixtures and explicitly separate read-only views from administrative
operations. No promise to remove the original engine's authenticated reveal route
is hidden inside a visual redesign. Compare desktop and narrow layouts, keyboard
focus and actual action results; source assertions alone do not establish usability.
