# Contributing

Start with the [onboarding](docs/ONBOARDING.md), [compatibility policy](docs/COMPATIBILITY.md)
and [security boundary](SECURITY.md). Code, tests and defaults must be usable
without the author's accounts, projects or paths.

```sh
python -m pip install -c requirements-full.lock '.[full]'
python -m unittest discover -s tests -v
project-observatory full check
python tools/check_public_release.py --history
python docs/site/check.py --self-test
```

A maintainer who holds the private predecessor also passes
`--private-denylist FILE`: a local JSON array of private names, never committed. Names this
repository publishes on purpose, such as the author and the author's public projects, are listed
with a reason in `tools/public-identifiers.json` and subtracted from that list. An entry there is a
review decision. It is not a way to silence a finding, and an entry without a reason fails the check.

Use synthetic fixtures and isolated temporary workspaces. Never run the full
historical test directory indiscriminately against an operational home. The
portable runner lists its supported suites and labels live provider checks
separately. Tests must not depend on personal credentials or project inventory.

Do not alter a released database migration in place: add a migration, preserve
existing IDs/checksums, and test supported prefixes, rollback, WAL data and
future-version refusal. Preserve unknown optional configuration fields. Changes
to MCP input/output schemas and metric plugin requirements need explicit
compatibility tests. Keep the old portable command namespace working.

A change to the complete engine updates its source inventory in the same review:
run `python tools/update_inventory.py` (CI runs it with `--check`).
The initial inventory also records the sanitized extraction from its private
predecessor; never copy that predecessor's Git history or operational documents.
Dependency constraint updates require the Python/OS CI matrix, not just a local
import check. Build a wheel and run `tools/check_package.py` against it.

Update scenarios, onboarding and documentation with behavior. Keep unsupported
features and unexecuted tests clearly labelled. Public copy must cite reviewed
facts and never turn occurrence counts into unique-secret or breach counts.
New public assets require an explicit path and content review before entering
the release allowlist.

## Interface strings

The dashboard's text is English in the code and translated from one catalog per
language (`observatory/engine/dashboard/locales/`), read by both the page builder and
the page script. To add or change a string:

- write it in English as the message id: `T("{n} projects", {n})` in the page script,
  `t("…")`, `t.mark("…")` or `t.attr(name, "…")` in Python, or `data-t` on a static
  element of the template;
- add the Russian to `locales/ru.json`, with the same `{placeholders}`; a count takes
  a plural object (`one`, `few`, `many`, `other` in Russian, `one`, `other` in `en.json`);
- when one English text needs two Russian forms, give it a context: `domain@@not measured`;
- run `python -m unittest observatory/engine/tests/test_i18n.py` (from `observatory/engine`),
  which fails on a missing or unused translation, mismatched placeholders, incomplete plural
  forms or Russian text left in the sources.

Finding texts written by the rules in `tools/*_findings.py` are data in English, not
interface strings. The PassionCode design tokens in `dashboard/brand/` are vendored
bytes: change them at the canonical source, then copy and repin (`brand/README.md`).

## Comments and design notes

This repository is the engine's upstream, so its comments and docstrings are the design record:
explain *why* a function exists, which failure it guards against, and which document governs it.
They must not name private projects, people, hosts, paths or credential values, and they must not
cite decision records that live outside this repository. The first public export removed every
comment; on 2026-09-23 3,049 lines were restored from the original sources, each one filtered for
private identifiers and each file verified to have an unchanged syntax tree.
